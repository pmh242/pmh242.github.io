We should always ask ourselves why we do things, what moves us in life, why I chose such a profession, why I chose such a career, and in the case of university studies it seems fundamental, since it is a significant investment of time and money that has a direct impact on the rest of our lives.

***A purely practical science***

I tried to self learn to program, because programming allows you to create solutions to problems. It is the practical nature of programming that attracts me so much. I am a person who likes to see results and programming allows us to create a program in just a few minutes and see it work from that moment (even if I don't do anything useful). Then we can add a line of code and immediately see the effect it has. It is wonderful.

***Programming helps us solve many problems that until now we did not know how to achieve***

Learning to program is not as difficult as people think, it is not as different as learning to play an instrument, cooking or playing a sport, at first it seems difficult, but as you learn it becomes more and more interesting and easy. Programming is like having super powers because it gives you that possibility to create your own projects, that freedom to be able to create new things, expand all your horizons and above all it helps you to change your way of thinking.


**It is a rise and fall of emotions**

After writing a couple of lines of code and testing it, you realize that you have a logic error, you don't get the result that you are supposed to get, which makes you curse who gave you a certain lab/project, the worst part is that everything is "Correctly" written and the computer does exactly what you asked it to do.

After a couple of minutes to calm down and follow the steps you indicated in your own mind (desktop test) it is your mind that really solves the problem because it is you who indicates what to do what makes you say that you are the best in this.

***A message for all programmers***

If you are a programmer or know how to program, I would like you to be aware of the tremendous power you have in your hands. We live in a time when computers (and their more modern derivatives, tablets and smartphones) are used for everything, and you are one of the few people in the world capable of giving instructions to those machines to do something Useful. You can create programs that solve problems or make life easier for people. You can create web pages and applications accessible by billions of people from anywhere on earth. And thanks to the Internet you can do it from home and at practically zero cost!. Remember with great power comes great responsibility, always use your skills for good!.
